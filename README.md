## Overview of Project

### Project Topic

The chosen topic for this project is "Understanding and Predicting Labour Demands in Various Canadation Sectors".

This topic was selected to understand how the labour market will look like post-COVID. Understanding the labour market and looking at potential vacancies could go a long way in avoiding situations such as economic collapse and could also potentially assist with education planning.

### Data Source

All data used for the project was collected from the official Government of Canada website. The starting dataset was the [Job vacancies, proportion of job vacancies and average offered hourly wage by selected characteristics, quarterly, unadjusted for seasonality - Dataset](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/67f90ff0-12ea-429a-99a6-7b41c73863a0/resource/2cfa6a73-0b66-4b6e-a07b-7285f0ea774c) which contains number of job vacancies for various industries, categorized by National Occupational Classification (NOC) codes, every month from January 2015 to April 2021.

The original data set contains standardized column information, however, for the purpose of this project, it was cleaned to contain information needed to achieve the project goals. 

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to make use of machine learning to predict and determine the amount of job vacancies in upcoming quarters based on previous trends.

## Communication Protocols

The team made use of Slack, Zoom and various Google apps to communicate, meeting every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday
